# Github API JavaScript

With this project it is possible to fetch data from a API, in this case the Github API. 
It is possible to add authorization tokens, so that you can access private repositories for example. 
Inside the app.js there is some commented code that explains possible use cases! If you have questions or found bugs, please let me know.
